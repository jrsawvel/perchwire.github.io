I'm building this test website by using Jekyll with GitHub pages, but I'm not using a local install of Jekyll, which requires committing web posts.

I'm using GitHub's web browser editor to create and update pages.

I created a new GitHub account with username perchwire.

I followed instructions at <https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now> and I forked that repository. Then I changed the name to perchwire.github.io. The repository is helpful for getting started with using Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

The author of the above repository also created this helpful  smashingmagazine.com article titled [Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages).

In addition to using GitHub's web browser editor to maintain content, I'm testing Development Seed's editor called [Prose](http://prose.io), which is designed to work with GitHub Pages by connecting to a GitHub account. It's pretty slick. Well done.
